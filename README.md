# Nondeterministic and probabilistic programming

This programming project is to develop libraries and tools to support
nondeterministic or probabilistic programming in a functional language through
the development of appropriate monads.

This programming project is performed for the course: [MPRI 2.4 - Functional programming and type systems](http://gallium.inria.fr/~xleroy/mpri/2-4/index.html#project)
