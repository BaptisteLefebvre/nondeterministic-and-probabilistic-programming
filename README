Here is the short README accompanying the .ml and .mli files of /src which
contain my code for the programming project "Nondeterministic and probabilistic
programming with monads and iterative deepening" (February 2015).

I have completed all tasks.

I have filled the holes carefully and then tested my implementation with tests
provided. I have often changed the 'maxdepth' and sometimes write additional
tests to check how it works well. In fact all the tests have been passed
successfully.

The .ml and .mli files in /src correspond to the origial files with the holes
filled and two changes :

  - in /src/Typing.ml to avoid failure with a stack overflow
    from
      let _ = print_run print_term 25 ex3
    to
      let _ = print_run print_term 22 ex3

  - in /src/Mtyping.ml to fix generator of types which does not give types t
    of the form  (t1 -> t2) -> int  where  t1 != t2  during the tests of
    /src/Mtyping.ml
    from
      let any_mtyp() : mtyp =
        fixmemo (fun any_mtyp -> mint ||| mfun any_mtyp any_mtyp)
    to
      let any_mtyp() : mtyp =
        fixmemo
          (fun any_mtyp1 ->
            mint
            ||| fixmemo
	      (fun any_mtyp2 ->
	        mfun any_mtyp1 mint
                ||| mfun any_mtyp1 any_mtyp2))

I have no further comments to add.

Best regards,
Baptiste Lefebvre
